- model
  - The models to represent the domain live in this module.
- gateway
  - all external interaction objects(e.g. files, external APIs etc) live in this module
- main
  - cli
    - the command line interface into the application lives in this module
  - if one were to need to expose this service over REST, gRPC, as library etc, they simply add a module here that provides the interface they want expose.
